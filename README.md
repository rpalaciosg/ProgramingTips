# ProgramingTips
**App that display tips of differents tecnologies, libraries and programing languajes.**<br/><br/>
*This idea is based on the Codecademy post [JavaScript Tips Tab](https://medium.com/@codecademy/javascript-tips-tab-4e9081b4132), where you build your own Chrome extension to show tips JS on new tabs!.*<br/><br/>
In theory, the goal is to be able to have a reminder of programming languages, libraries, keyboard shortcuts, or any technology in order not to forget what you are learning.
